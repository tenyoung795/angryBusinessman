Buggies!

When a client (not the host) leaves (he exits, not die), everyone else's game ends, too.
     Fixed 1/28, circa 9 PM
A dead player stops receiving the alive player's input...
  ...now a dead client freezes the host.
  Fixed 1/28, 10:38 PM
Clicking X on a dead client doesn't work.
	 False assumption that the dead are incapable of ALL input--they can still exit.
	 ...now client and host off sync.
	 Client receives from other clients that don't exist.
	 All above fixed 1/29, 12:48 AM
Segfault occurs shortly after a player is attacked.
	 ...because the player's attack is not set to NULL after being freed.

More than two players can't play together. Causes segfault.
     Fixed 1/30, 4:14 PM
The host and the last client respond to their own input, but the others don't.
    Because all clients were assigned the same playerno.
